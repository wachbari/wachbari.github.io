# Bio

I am an interdisciplinary social scientist (Ph.D., University of Edinburgh) focusing on social cohesion. Substantively, my expertise spans the social cohesion, ethnic diversity, economic inequality, and crime, whilst methodologically I employ advanced statistical methods and computational tools.

Previously I have held different research positions across Europe and obtained a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship at the University of Amsterdam (co-funded by the European Commission) titled Trust Radius.

In my work I seek to understand the processes behind the creation and loss of generalized trust, confidence in governments, and crime. I am particularly interested in the impact of ethnic diversity and inequality on these phenomena, but also the methodological implications that follow from extant research. I use a wide range of statistical techniques such as multilevel models, structural equation modelling, (spatial) panel analysis, and recently machine learning. I draw on survey questionnaires, register data, and experimental data.
